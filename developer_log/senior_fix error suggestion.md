You are absolutely right! The error message clearly points out the problem:

```
[segment @ 0x7f96d09062c0] segment_time, segment_times, and segment_frames options are mutually exclusive, select just one of them
```

This means you cannot use both `-segment_time` and `-segment_times` in the same `ffmpeg` command. My apologies for the oversight in the previous review.

Looking at your current `detect_scenes` function:

```bash
# Second pass: Split video using segment muxer
echo "Splitting video at detected scenes..."
if ! ffmpeg -v error -i "$input_video" \
    -f segment \
    -segment_times "$(awk '/pts_time/ {printf "%s,", $2}' "${TEMP_DIR}/scenes.txt" | sed 's/,$//')" \
    -segment_time "$min_duration" \
    -reset_timestamps 1 \
    $codec_params \
    -segment_format "$format" \
    "${output_dir}/${prefix}_%03d.${format}"; then
    error "Video splitting failed. FFmpeg error log:"
    cat "${TEMP_DIR}/ffmpeg_error.log"
    return 1
fi
```

You are indeed using both `-segment_times` (to split at the detected scene changes) and `-segment_time` (to enforce the minimum duration), which is causing the conflict.

**Here's how to fix it:**

You need to choose **one** method for segmenting. Since you want to split at scene changes *and* have a minimum duration, the best approach is to use the `segment` filter within the `-vf` option along with the `select` filter. This allows you to define both conditions in a single pass.

**Modified `detect_scenes` Function:**

```bash
# Function to detect and split scenes in one step
detect_scenes() {
    local input_video="${settings[input_video]}"
    local output_dir="${settings[output_dir]}"
    local threshold="${settings[threshold]}"
    local format="${settings[output_format]}"
    local codec="${settings[codec]}"
    local prefix="${settings[scene_prefix]}"
    local min_duration="${settings[min_duration]}"
    local temp_scenes_file="${TEMP_DIR}/scenes.txt"

    mkdir -p "$TEMP_DIR"

    echo "Debug: Starting scene detection and splitting..."

    local codec_params
    if [[ "$codec" == "copy" ]]; then
        codec_params="-c copy"
    else
        codec_params=$(configure_codec_params "$codec")
    fi

    # Detect scenes and split video using segment muxer and select filter
    echo "Detecting and splitting scenes..."
    if ! ffmpeg -v error -i "$input_video" \
        -vf "select='gte(scene,$threshold)',segment='duration=$min_duration:format=$format:filename=${output_dir}/${prefix}_%03d',metadata=print:file=${temp_scenes_file}" \
        -an -y 2>"${TEMP_DIR}/ffmpeg_error.log"; then
        error "Scene detection and splitting failed. FFmpeg error log:"
        cat "${TEMP_DIR}/ffmpeg_error.log"
        return 1
    fi

    # Count the number of generated segments
    local scene_count=$(find "$output_dir" -maxdepth 1 -name "${prefix}_*.${format}" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)

    if (( scene_count <= 1 )); then
        echo "No scenes detected. Debug information:"
        echo "  Current threshold: $threshold (try values between 0.1 and 0.4)"
        if [[ -f "${temp_scenes_file}" ]]; then
            echo "  Scene detection output (first 20 lines):"
            head -n 20 "${temp_scenes_file}"
        fi
        error "No scenes detected. Try adjusting the threshold value."
        return 1
    fi

    echo "Scene detection and splitting complete:"
    echo "  Total scenes: $scene_count"
    echo "  Output files are in: $output_dir"

    success "Scene detection and splitting completed successfully"
    return 0
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Single FFmpeg Command:**  The `detect_scenes` function now uses a single `ffmpeg` command.
2. **`segment` Filter in `-vf`:** The core logic is now within the `-vf` (video filter) option:
    *   `select='gte(scene,$threshold)'`: This selects frames where the scene change score is greater than or equal to the threshold.
    *   `segment='duration=$min_duration:format=$format:filename=${output_dir}/${prefix}_%03d'`: This tells FFmpeg to create segments.
        *   `duration=$min_duration`: Ensures each segment has a minimum duration.
        *   `format=$format`: Specifies the output format for the segments.
        *   `filename=${output_dir}/${prefix}_%03d`: Defines the naming pattern for the output files.
    *   `metadata=print:file=${temp_scenes_file}`: This still captures the scene change information for debugging.
3. **`-an`:**  I've added `-an` to disable audio processing in this command. Since you are using `-c copy` or specifying audio codecs in `$codec_params`, it's best to handle audio separately or ensure your `$codec_params` include audio settings when re-encoding. If you want to include audio directly in this command (without relying on `$codec_params`), you would need to add audio codec options here as well (e.g., `-c:a aac`).
4. **Removed `-f segment`, `-segment_times`, `-segment_time`, `-reset_timestamps`, `-segment_format`:** These options are no longer needed as the segmentation is handled by the `segment` filter within `-vf`.
5. **Simplified Codec Handling:** The codec parameters (`$codec_params`) will be applied to the segments created by the `segment` filter.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Audio Handling:**  The current modification disables audio. You need to decide how you want to handle audio:
    *   **If using `-c copy`:** The audio stream will be copied along with the video.
    *   **If re-encoding (codec is not `copy`):** Ensure your `configure_codec_params` function includes audio codec settings (e.g., `-c:a aac`). If you want to handle audio within this `ffmpeg` command, you'll need to add audio codec options here (e.g., `-c:a aac`).
*   **Minimum Duration Enforcement:** The `duration=$min_duration` in the `segment` filter ensures that segments will be at least the specified minimum duration. If a scene change occurs before the minimum duration is reached, the segment will extend until the minimum duration is met.

**How to Use the Fixed Script:**

1. **Save:** Save the modified code as `split_scenes`.
2. **Make Executable:** `chmod +x split_scenes`
3. **Run:** `./split_scenes`

This revised `detect_scenes` function should resolve the "mutually exclusive" error and provide a more robust way to split your video based on scene changes while respecting the minimum duration. Remember to consider the audio handling based on your specific requirements.
